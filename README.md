Course Project

The Plan

For my final front-end assignment I would like to create a site for a one-person consultation business. My mother is Human Resources director and just recently asked for me to create a logo for a consultation business she would like to open. I would love to take that further and create a site for her to display her qualifications, descriptions of service, and even a portal to request a meeting for a consultation. Although the information is not ready yet, I think it would give me some creative liberties to test out a variety of css and javascript functions.

I hope the pages would include:
Qualifications including written works
Description of the consultation process
Testimonials from previous clients
Vision and Values
Location to contact, requesting an appointment
Previous/Upcoming Events

The API I would use as a business site would be: SEO Checker API and an Email Check API. I will do the email checker API as that will be the way the link between user and consultant. I would prefer to look into the SEO API because the majority of the site will be text. However, I wonder if I can use this API without most of the language the site would realistically have.
